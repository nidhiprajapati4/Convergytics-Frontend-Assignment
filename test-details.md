======================= Convergytics Frontend Test =======================
Create a two page website, which contains:
1. A web form to accept the following inputs: 
  - Name, Designation, Contact Details, Summary, Work Experience(s), Education(s), Languages, Skills, Organizations, Honours and Awards, Conferences & Courses
2. Accept the form input and display a webpage in the format available in `resume-template.png`. Feel free to use CSS (Bootstrap, Grid or Flex), HTML & JS and a small web server (optional) preferably using Python (esp Django, Express, etc for quick prototyping). 

To make it work without a web server, you can use a GET request instead of a POST request when the user submits the form.

Text can be fixed for now or can remain the same as in the image shared.

More points if more values can be dynamically added and adjusted on the UI e.g. the UI should be responsive to any addition or deletion of skills and should not break.

More points for using media queries to design for mobile layouts as well.

Please reach out, if you have any questions.
